## Data Retrieval

This dataset comes from UK Power Networks (UKPN), which provides live information on current and planned power outages in southeastern England.
Data is accessed via the UK Power Networks Open Data Portal, powered by Opendatasoft.

🔗 https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/ukpn-live-faults/information/

The API endpoint used:

https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/ukpn-live-faults/records

Parameters used:
params = {
    "limit": 100,     # number of records per request
    "offset": offset  # pagination offset
}

Authentication:

This dataset is publicly accessible and does not require an API key.
However, requests should be rate-limited (e.g., 0.5–1.5 seconds between calls) to avoid throttling.

API Response Structure:

Each API response contains a JSON payload with an array of outage records in the results field:

{
  "results": [
    {
      "incidentreference": "INCD-23344-O",
      "powercuttype": "Planned",
      "creationdatetime": "2025-10-14T15:19:51",
      ...
    }
  ]
}

Code Process

The retrieval script:

Requests records 100 at a time using pagination (limit + offset).

Stores retrieved data in a pandas DataFrame.

If a CSV already exists (power_networks_power_outage.csv), new data is concatenated and duplicates are dropped using the incidentreference field.

Each iteration pauses 0.5–1.5 seconds before requesting the next batch.

The process ends when fewer than 100 records are returned (indicating the final page).

This ensures a complete, up-to-date collection of outages from the UK Power Networks live feed.

## Other Notes

The dataset updates approximately every 10 minutes.

Outage categories include Planned (maintenance) and Unplanned (faults).

Timestamps follow UTC (ISO 8601 format).
